# Planned Features


## Fragmentation Optimization Service
External background service that continuously monitors all datasets and their constituent data ranges. When excessive fragmentation (multiple small adjacent data ranges) is detected, the service consolidates them into optimized contiguous ranges and uploads these consolidated ranges as atomic updates to the dataset. Implement an adaptive polling frequency algorithm that dynamically adjusts monitoring intervals based on dataset characteristics including size, fragmentation patterns, and update frequency to maintain optimal performance while minimizing resource consumption.
