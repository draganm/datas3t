# Planned Features


## Atomic Data Range Consolidation Endpoint
Implement an API endpoint that enables clients to upload an optimized data range that supersedes multiple existing ranges. The endpoint should:
- Accept a new consolidated data range that fully encompasses existing smaller ranges
- Perform integrity validation by:
  - Generating an xxhash checksum for the new data range
  - Verifying against the combined xxhash of individual datapoint hashes in existing ranges
- Execute an atomic transaction that:
  1. Stores the consolidated range
  2. Deletes all superseded ranges
  3. Updates dataset metadata
- Ensure transactional consistency through hash validation before any destructive operations


## Fragmentation Optimization Service
External background service that continuously monitors all datasets and their constituent data ranges. When excessive fragmentation (multiple small adjacent data ranges) is detected, the service consolidates them into optimized contiguous ranges and uploads these consolidated ranges as atomic updates to the dataset. Implement an adaptive polling frequency algorithm that dynamically adjusts monitoring intervals based on dataset characteristics including size, fragmentation patterns, and update frequency to maintain optimal performance while minimizing resource consumption.
