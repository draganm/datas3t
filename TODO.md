# Planned Features


## Atomic Data Range Aggregation Endpoint: POST /api/v1/datas3t/{id}/aggregate/{start}/{end}
Implement an API endpoint that enables clients to trigger aggregating multiple dataranges into a single data range that superseeds the smaller ranges. The endpoint should:
- Accept {start} and {end} datapoint IDs.
- The new datarange has to completely replace existing dataranges. After the operation, the invariant of no two dataranges are overlaping should still hold.
- Execute an atomic transaction that:
  1. Stores the consolidated range
  2. Deletes all superseded ranges
  3. Updates dataset metadata
- Ensure transactional consistency through hash validation before any destructive operations


## Fragmentation Optimization Service
External background service that continuously monitors all datasets and their constituent data ranges. When excessive fragmentation (multiple small adjacent data ranges) is detected, the service consolidates them into optimized contiguous ranges and uploads these consolidated ranges as atomic updates to the dataset. Implement an adaptive polling frequency algorithm that dynamically adjusts monitoring intervals based on dataset characteristics including size, fragmentation patterns, and update frequency to maintain optimal performance while minimizing resource consumption.
